We prepare 4 levels for assumptions.And the order of assumption is from level1 to level4.In each level you have one change to assumpt the value of one off 9X9 cells. for example we suppose the cell of line 5 row 2 with the value of 6.So here the value of level1 is 6.Continue to be you can set the assumption of level2 which is based on level1.For example here we suppose the cell of line 8 and row 3 with the value of 3.That means if the level1's assumption is really true the value of line8 row3 may come to the value of 3.
